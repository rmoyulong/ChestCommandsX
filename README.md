ChestCommandsX
===================

Fork of ChestCommands by CadsMC, modernized for Paper/Folia 26.1.2 and Java 25.

API Javadoc for developers: https://ci.codemc.io/job/filoghost/job/ChestCommands/javadoc/index.html?me/filoghost/chestcommands/api/ChestCommandsAPI.html

## Requirements
- Paper, Folia, or a compatible Bukkit implementation based on Minecraft 26.1.2 or newer.
- Java 25 or newer.
- Vault is optional and only required for economy features.
- PlaceholderAPI is optional and only required for external placeholders.

## Build
```powershell
gradle build
```

The plugin jar is created at `plugin/build/libs/chestcommands-plugin-5.1.2.jar`.

## Gradle
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-public/") }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly "me.filoghost.chestcommands:chestcommands-api:5.1.2"
}
```

## Configuration Notes
- Use modern material names such as `DIAMOND_SWORD`, `WHITE_WOOL`, and `REDSTONE_LAMP`.
- Commands under `menu-settings.commands` are dynamically registered. Use `menu`, not `/menu`, and avoid names already used by other plugins. Sub-commands such as `shop 1` are supported.
- Use `/cc sound <sound> [pitch] [volume]` to test available Minecraft sounds in-game. The sound argument supports tab completion.
- Folia is declared as supported. Player inventory/menu work is scheduled on the player entity scheduler, while global tasks use Folia's global scheduler. The legacy update checker and bStats scheduler hooks are disabled on Folia.
- Use `DAMAGE` for item damage. Legacy material data values like `WOOL:14` are not supported.
- `NBT-DATA` is no longer supported. Use supported metadata keys such as `COLOR`, `SKULL-OWNER`, `ENCHANTMENTS`, `CUSTOM-MODEL-DATA`, `UNBREAKABLE`, and `ITEM-FLAGS`.
- `boss-bar:` uses the native Bukkit boss bar API. The old `dragon-bar:` prefix still works as an alias.
- `POSITION-X` and `POSITION-Y` support ranges such as `3-4` and dynamic integer placeholders.
- `MATERIAL: AIR` can be used for invisible clickable slots, and `DRAG: true` allows a slot to accept normal item movement.
